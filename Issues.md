# Current Issues

### Possible needs more introduction / exmaples


- [ ] How to open the dev project in Xcode (currently xcode isnt opening the project)
- [ ] Possibility of opening issues to see what issues users have (currently on my end the selection overlay is not usable)
- [ ] Investigate which extensions are not playing nice with Windowed and work around that or warn the user
