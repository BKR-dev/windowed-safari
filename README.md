> [!NOTE]
> The released extension is signed with my own Apple Developer ID without any verification from the Apple Developer Program. So it won't show up in the Apple Extension Gallery - App Store. It would be great if someone can help me to sign the extension with a verified Apple Developer ID to distribute it in the App Store. Please get in touch with me if you are willing to help. :bowtie:
